#  Search Problem Using Java 
Our project was for academic purposes. Our project starts with a m×n grid of cells where 5 ≤ m, n ≤ 15. 

Initially, a grid cell is either free or contains one of the following: Our Robot or Host or Pads or Enemy or a Pill or a submarine.

**The purpose :** is to use search to help our Robot complete the mission by finding all the injured Host and bringing them back to the submarine 
the submarine.

### Implementing different types of search mentioned below :-

1) Breadth-first search
2) Depth-first search.
3) Iterative deepening search. 
4) Uniform-cost search.
5) Greedy search with at least two heuristics.
6) A∗ search with at least two admissible heuristics.
